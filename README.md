# jetpack-core

This repository contains primary classes used to power the Jetpack Transmission Protocol.

Note that this also contains `TransmissionManager`, which is supposed to be used in a client context. This class should only be used as an example for creating applications that follow the Jetpack Transmission Protocol.

## Development

The file `Jetpack Test Server.jar` is included in the repository. When run in a console, this will automatically accept all connections made by the `TransmissionManager`.
